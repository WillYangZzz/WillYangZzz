### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer with a diverse background in Education. I have participated in a variety of projects during my time in Dev Academy Aotearoa, which have equipped me with modern web development stacks such as React and NodeJS, as well as an ability to quickly pick up with new technologies. 

With 10+ years of experience in the education sector, I've always been a problem solver, adept at recognizing challenges and devising efficient, targeted solutions. This journey has honed my communication skills, empathy, and collaboration abilities to work in a team. 

I'm excited about the endless possibilities in the tech world and I'm eager to be part of this innovation and creativity.
